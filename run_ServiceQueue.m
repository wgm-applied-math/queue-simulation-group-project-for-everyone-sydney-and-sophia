    % Pull out samples of the number of customers in the queue system. Each

    % counts, because tables like q.Log allow easy extraction of whole

% Join all the samples. "vertcat" is short for "vertical concatenate",
% meaning it joins a bunch of arrays vertically, which in this case results

% MATLAB-ism: When you pull multiple items from a cell array, the result is
% a "comma-separated list" rather than some kind of array.  Thus, the above
% means
%
%    NInSystem = horzcat(NInSystemSamples{1}, NInSystemSamples{2}, ...)
%
% which horizontally concatenates all the lists of numbers in
% NInSystemSamples.
%
% This is roughly equivalent to "splatting" in Python, which looks like
% f(*args).

% area of the bar at horizontal index n is proportional to the fraction of
% samples for which there were n customers in the system.

% further plotting function to work with the same picture rather than
% create a new one.
